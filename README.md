# SnapMotion - Spectacles AR Motion Game

![SnapMotion Game Demo](vid.mp4)


A motion-controlled AR game developed for Snap Spectacles using Lens Studio. Players control an ascending tennis ball through various levels by physical movement, interacting with floating platforms and collecting rewards.

## 📱 Project Overview

SnapMotion is an augmented reality game that uses the Snap Spectacles motion tracking capabilities to create an engaging vertical platformer experience. Players guide a tennis ball upward through increasingly challenging levels, with dynamic difficulty scaling and interactive elements.

### Key Features

- Motion-controlled tennis ball movement
- Progressive difficulty scaling
- Dynamic platform generation
- Level-based progression system
- Collision detection system
- Visual feedback and congratulations system
- Adjustable game parameters through Inspector
